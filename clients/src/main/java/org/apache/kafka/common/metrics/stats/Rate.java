         * Here we check the total amount of time elapsed since the oldest non-obsolete window.
         * This gives the duration of computation time window which used to calculate Rate.
         *
         * For scenarios when rate computation is performed after at least `config.samples` have completed,
         * the duration of computation time window is determined by:
         *      window duration = (now - start time of oldest non-obsolete window)
         *
         * Note that, alternatively window duration could be determined by:
         *      `window duration = duration of (config.samples() - 1) windows + amount of time elapsed in the current window`
         * But this approach would be incorrect because it does not consider the situations where a slice of time will
         * not be part of any window. Since, SampledStat only creates samples whenever record is called, the following
         * scenario can occur.
         *      Time = T1: Window#1 start with config.timeWindowMs = 1s
         *      Time = T1 + 0.9s: Last observed record call
         *      Time = T1 + 1.7s: New record call
         * Here, Window#1 duration is from T1 to T1 + 1s. There is no window that exists from T1+1s to T1+1.7s.
         * Window#2 starts from T1 + 1.7s. If we calculate duration of computation time window using the method above
         * it would ignore the slice of time which belongs to no window.
         *
         * ## Special case: First ever window
         * A special scenario occurs when rate calculation is performed before at least `config.samples` have completed
         * (e.g. if only 1 second has elapsed in a 30 second). In such a scenario, window duration would be equal to the
         * time elapsed in the current window (since oldest non-obsolete window is current window). This leads to an
         * incorrect value for rate. Consider the following example:
         *      config.timeWindowMs() = 1s
         *      config.samples() = 2
         *      Record events (E) at timestamps:
         *          E1 = CurrentTimeStamp (T1)
         *          E2 = T1 + 30ms
         *          E2 = T1 + 60ms
         *      Rate calculated at T1 + 20ms = 1/0.02s = 50 events per second
         *      Rate calculated at T1 + 50ms = 2/0.05s = 40 events per second
         *      Rate calculated at T2 + 60ms = 3/0.06s = 50 events per second
         * These incorrect/inflated rate calculations leads the system to provide artificially high rate than actual.
         * The algorithm in this function has a special handling for such cases.
         *
         * ## Special case: First window after prolonged period of no record events
         * Another special scenario occurs when a record event is received after multiples of `config.timeWindowMs`
         * have elapsed since the last record event. In such a scenario, all the older samples would have been
         * considered obsolete and would have been removed at the beginning of this function. Note that this scenario is
         * different from Special Case of First ever window because unlike first ever window (where prior window is
         * missing), this scenario genuinely has a prior window with zero events. The algorithm in this function has a
         * special handling for such cases.
